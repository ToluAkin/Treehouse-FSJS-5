# Public API requests: Employee Directory

An app to share contact information in a company. The project was built with vanilla javascript.
   
    Applied:
        DRY principle
        Recursion
1. The data pulled displays 12 random users from a single API request.
2. From the API request, I displayed some basic information that included; name, location, email address and phone number.
3. The employees can dynamically be filtered by name.
4. When the card of a particular employee is clicked, a modal containing more information about the employee is shown.
5. Navigating forth and back on the modal to display other employees can be done.
6. On the first card, there is no previous button and on the last card, there is no next button. Both buttons were not
   displayed in both cases.
