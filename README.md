Public API requests: An app to share contact information in a company
The data pulled displays 12 random users from a single API request.
From the API request, I displayed some basic information that included; name, location, email address and phone number.
The employees can dynamically be filtered by name.
When the card of a particular employee is clicked, a modal containing more information about the employee is shown.
Navigating forth and back on the modal to display other employees can be done. 
On the first card, there is no previous button and on the last card, there is no next button. Both buttons were not
displayed in both cases.

Style Adjustments
Added a class `d-none` to `display none`
Changed the `background color` of the body
Add `padding` to card when hovered on
Updated the `border-radius, padding, border color` of the search button
Updated the `border color` of the search input
Updated the `background color, border-radius and border color` of the card
Updated the `background color and border-radius` of the modal close button
Added `line-height and font-weight` and updated `color, background, border` of the navigation buttons on the modal
